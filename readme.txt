This folder include three .ma files.
volcanic_large.ma is used to simulate the largest size volcanic particles with d=8mm . 

volcanic_med.ma is used to simulate the medium size volcanic particles with d=0.354mm

volcanic_large.ma is used to simulate the smaller size volcanic particles with d=0.125mm

I didn't include .log files of three execution, because the size of log files are 13 GB together.
